title: How NOT to convert Simplified and Traditional Chinese

**tl;dr** Do not use a random website or tool you find on the internet.

## Languages and Scripts

Chinese can be written in two different types of script, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. I often get asked about these scripts and would like to put together things to know when it comes to handling those scripts.

First off, these are *scripts*, not languages. These two are somewhat separate concepts. People often get confused by the fact that we often see both "Chinese (Simplified)" and "Chinese (Traditional)" in language menus on websites, but you can write, for example, Mandarin Chinese, in either of those two scripts. Mandarin Chinese, which is the official language for both mainland China and Taiwan, is usually written in Simplified Chinese in Mainland China (and also in Singapore) and in Traditional Chinese (and also in Malaysia) in Taiwan.

## N-to-N Mapping

Another pitfall regarding Simplified and Traditional Chinese is that there is often no simple 1-to-1 character mapping between those two scripts. This is something far more complex than e.g., English upper and lower cases. It is true that there is actually 1-to-1 mapping between many characters, most of which involve simplification of radicals as shown below, but for more common and high frequent characters, one simplified form corresponds to multiple traditional form.

Characters with 1-to-1 Mappings

There are, though not many, characters with Many-to-1 mappings:

| 著                | 著             |  zhu4 - to write      |
